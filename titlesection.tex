\section{About this Journal}
The Lewis \& Clark College ACM Student Chapter's \textit{Journal of Student Research} is a student-organized, peer-reviewed journal open to all Lewis \& Clark College students. The committee is made up of students who serve on the board of the Lewis \& Clark College ACM Student Chapter, with help from the Chapter's faculty and staff advisors. In addition to students on the board, volunteer peer-reviewers were also recruited from upper-level computer science students. The aim of this journal is to provide a realistic introduction to the process of submitting peer-reviewed research, allow students to develop their technical writing skills, and show off interesting projects they have worked on.

Authors' majors included Computer Science, Biology, Studio Art, and Economics.
